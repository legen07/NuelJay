 * The function converts images in a source directory to a specified format and
 * compresses them, while also copying non-image files to a destination directory.
 *
 * @param settings                    The settings object
 * @param settings.srcDir             The source directory from where the images will be read and
 *                                   converted.
 * @param settings.distDir            The destination directory where the converted images will be
 *                                   saved. If no value is provided, the images will be saved in the same directory as
 *                                   the source images.
 * @param settings.compressionOptions An optional object that contains compression settings
 *                                   for different image formats. The default value is an empty object. The object should
 *                                   have keys that correspond to image formats (e.g. "jpg", "png", "webp") and values
 *                                   that are objects containing compression settings for that format (e.g. "no", "mozjpeg", "jpeg").
